title: "M√©thode de segmentation"
---

De nombreuses m√©thodes sont impl√©ment√©s dans l'application afin de comparer les m√©thodes selon la distribution des donn√©es et des objectifs de la segmentation.

Certaines m√©thodes ont √©t√© √©valu√©s dans un comparatif sur des donn√©es simul√©es (De Almeida et al., in press).

## BEAST

BEAST (Bayesian Estimator of Abrupt Change, Seasonal Change, and Trend) is an algorithm designed to detect abrupt change points in time series data, as well as to capture underlying trends and seasonal cycles (Zhao et al., 2019). See [Rbeast](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rbeast/Rbeast.pdf) package

## Binary Segmentation

Binary Segmentation is an approximate, greedy algorithm that sequentially identifies change points in an iterative process (Scott & Knott, 1974 ; Sen & Srivastava, 1975). See [changepoint](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/changepoint/changepoint.pdf) package

## PELT

PELT (Pruned Exact Linear Time) is an exact algorithm that efficiently identifies optimal change points by using dynamic programming combined with pruning strategies to reduce computational time (Killick et al., 2012). See [changepoint](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/changepoint/changepoint.pdf) package

## Segment Neighbourhood 

Segment Neighbourhood is another exact algorithm that employs dynamic programming to exhaustively search for the optimal segmentation by considering all possible combinations of change points up to a specified maximum number (Auger & Lawrence, 1989 ; Bai & Perron, 2003). See [changepoint](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/changepoint/changepoint.pdf) package

## Pettitt

## Hubert

Hubert\'s method is designed to optimally partition a continuous data series into ùëò homogeneous segments by maximizing the contrast between adjacent segments while ensuring homogeneity within each segment (Hubert, 1989 ; Hubert et al., 2000). See [hubr](https://github.com/lvaudor/hubr/tree/master) package

## CumSeg

CumSeg (Cumulative Segmentation) is another optimization technique, primarily designed for detecting breakpoints in genomic data (Muggeo & Adelfio, 2011). See [cumSeg](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cumSeg/cumSeg.pdf) package

## CPM

CPM (Change Point Model) is a framework that detects multiple change points in data series, particularly suited for hydrological and environmental datasets (Hawkins et al., 2003; Hawkins and Zamba, 2005). See [CPM](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cpm/cpm.pdf) package
